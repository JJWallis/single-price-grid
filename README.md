## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first challenge I attempted on the Front End Mentor without an official solution to reference. That whole concept was terrifying at first, but I quickly reaped the rewards by feeling more independant as a developer.

```html
<p class="light-grey">
   <strong class="price">$29</strong><span class="opaque">per month</span>
</p>
```

I used this project to practice using different semantic elements where appropriate. These tags provide extra semantic meaning to screen readers for visually impaired users, so it's important we consider that when writing out our markup.

```css

```

Grid item height auto-responding to word wrapping | attempted fix with fixed widths - causes overflow | Grid column property to expand top row over 2 columns

### Continued development

Further learning - Individual corner radius for parent wrapper - desire to see if another method

submit sign up btn didn't refresh page - desire to understand why

### Useful resources
