###### TODO

HTML:

First Front End Mentor challenge - without formal solution (contrast to tutorials on Treehouse or YT)

Diff semantic els for text - strong for price + span to style 'per month' as slightly opaque all within same `p`

CSS:

Mobile column view with Grid not Flex | fluid btn width to match (100%)

Grid item height auto-responding to word wrapping | attempted fix with fixed widths - causes overflow | Grid column property to expand top row over 2 columns

Individual corner radius for parent wrapper - desire to see if another method
